# DATA CLEANING IN SQL

This SQL project focuses on the comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset containing global layoff information from 2020 to 2023. The dataset, provided in a .csv file, underwent a thorough cleaning process utilizing advanced SQL techniques such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Joins, and Window functions. Following the data cleaning, EDA was conducted to uncover trends, patterns, and insights within the dataset. The cleaned data, along with the SQL queries used for both data cleaning and EDA, is presented in a .sql file, demonstrating a systematic approach to preparing and analyzing the dataset for further insights.
